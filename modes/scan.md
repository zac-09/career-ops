# Mode: scan — Portal Scanner (Offer Discovery)

Scans configured job portals, filters by title relevance, and adds new offers to pipeline for later evaluation.

## Recommended Execution

Run as subagent to avoid consuming main context:

```
Agent(
    subagent_type="general-purpose",
    prompt="[content of this file + specific data]",
    run_in_background=True
)
```

## Configuration

Read `portals.yml` which contains:
- `search_queries`: List of WebSearch queries with `site:` filters by portal (broad discovery)
- `tracked_companies`: Specific companies with `careers_url` for direct navigation
- `title_filter`: Positive/negative/seniority_boost keywords for title filtering

## Discovery Strategy (3 levels)

### Level 1 — Direct Playwright (PRIMARY)

**For each company in `tracked_companies`:** Navigate to their `careers_url` with Playwright (`browser_navigate` + `browser_snapshot`), read ALL visible job listings, and extract title + URL for each. This is the most reliable method because:
- Sees page in real-time (not cached Google results)
- Works with SPAs (Ashby, Lever, Workday)
- Detects new offers instantly
- Doesn't depend on Google indexing

**Every company MUST have `careers_url` in portals.yml.** If it doesn't, search for it once, save it, and use in future scans.

### Level 2 — Greenhouse API (COMPLEMENTARY)

For companies with Greenhouse, the JSON API (`boards-api.greenhouse.io/v1/boards/{slug}/jobs`) returns clean structured data. Use as quick complement to Level 1 — faster than Playwright but only works with Greenhouse.

### Level 3 — WebSearch queries (BROAD DISCOVERY)

The `search_queries` with `site:` filters cover portals transversally (all Ashby, all Greenhouse, etc.). Useful for discovering NEW companies not yet in `tracked_companies`, but results may be stale.

**Execution priority:**
1. Level 1: Playwright → all `tracked_companies` with `careers_url`
2. Level 2: API → all `tracked_companies` with `api:`
3. Level 3: WebSearch → all `search_queries` with `enabled: true`

Levels are additive — all execute, results merge and deduplicate.

## Workflow

1. **Read configuration**: `portals.yml`
2. **Read history**: `data/scan-history.tsv` → already-seen URLs
3. **Read dedup sources**: `data/applications.md` + `data/pipeline.md`

4. **Level 1 — Playwright scan** (parallel in batches of 3-5):
   For each company in `tracked_companies` with `enabled: true` and `careers_url` defined:
   a. `browser_navigate` to `careers_url`
   b. `browser_snapshot` to read all job listings
   c. If page has filters/departments, navigate relevant sections
   d. For each job listing extract: `{title, url, company}`
   e. If page paginates results, navigate additional pages
   f. Accumulate in candidate list
   g. If `careers_url` fails (404, redirect), try `scan_query` as fallback and note to update URL

5. **Level 2 — Greenhouse APIs** (parallel):
   For each company in `tracked_companies` with `api:` defined and `enabled: true`:
   a. WebFetch the API URL → JSON with job list
   b. For each job extract: `{title, url, company}`
   c. Accumulate in candidate list (dedup with Level 1)

6. **Level 3 — WebSearch queries** (parallel if possible):
   For each query in `search_queries` with `enabled: true`:
   a. Execute WebSearch with defined `query`
   b. From each result extract: `{title, url, company}`
      - **title**: from result title (before " @ " or " | ")
      - **url**: result URL
      - **company**: after " @ " in title, or extract from domain/path
   c. Accumulate in candidate list (dedup with Level 1+2)

6. **Filter by title** using `title_filter` from `portals.yml`:
   - At least 1 keyword from `positive` must appear in title (case-insensitive)
   - 0 keywords from `negative` must appear
   - `seniority_boost` keywords give priority but aren't required

7. **Deduplicate** against 3 sources:
   - `scan-history.tsv` → exact URL already seen
   - `applications.md` → normalized company + role already evaluated
   - `pipeline.md` → exact URL already in pending or processed

8. **For each new offer that passes filters**:
   a. Add to `pipeline.md` "Pending" section: `- [ ] {url} | {company} | {title}`
   b. Register in `scan-history.tsv`: `{url}\t{date}\t{query_name}\t{title}\t{company}\tadded`

9. **Offers filtered by title**: register in `scan-history.tsv` with status `skipped_title`
10. **Duplicate offers**: register with status `skipped_dup`

## Title and Company Extraction from WebSearch Results

WebSearch results come in format: `"Job Title @ Company"` or `"Job Title | Company"` or `"Job Title — Company"`.

Extraction patterns by portal:
- **Ashby**: `"Senior Backend Engineer (Remote) @ EverAI"` → title: `Senior Backend Engineer`, company: `EverAI`
- **Greenhouse**: `"Backend Engineer at Anthropic"` → title: `Backend Engineer`, company: `Anthropic`
- **Lever**: `"Platform Engineer - Node.js @ Temporal"` → title: `Platform Engineer - Node.js`, company: `Temporal`

Generic regex: `(.+?)(?:\s*[@|—–-]\s*|\s+at\s+)(.+?)$`

## Private URLs

If a non-publicly accessible URL is found:
1. Save JD to `jds/{company}-{role-slug}.md`
2. Add to pipeline.md as: `- [ ] local:jds/{company}-{role-slug}.md | {company} | {title}`

## Scan History

`data/scan-history.tsv` tracks ALL seen URLs:

```
url	first_seen	portal	title	company	status
https://...	2026-02-10	Ashby — Backend	Senior BE	Acme	added
https://...	2026-02-10	Greenhouse — Platform	Junior Dev	BigCo	skipped_title
https://...	2026-02-10	Ashby — Backend	Staff Eng	OldCo	skipped_dup
```

## Output Summary

```
Portal Scan — {YYYY-MM-DD}
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
Queries executed: N
Offers found: N total
Filtered by title: N relevant
Duplicates: N (already evaluated or in pipeline)
New added to pipeline.md: N

  + {company} | {title} | {query_name}
  ...

→ Run /career-ops pipeline to evaluate new offers.
```

## careers_url Management

Every company in `tracked_companies` should have `careers_url` — the direct URL to their jobs page. This avoids searching for it each time.

**Known patterns by platform:**
- **Ashby:** `https://jobs.ashbyhq.com/{slug}`
- **Greenhouse:** `https://job-boards.greenhouse.io/{slug}` or `https://job-boards.eu.greenhouse.io/{slug}`
- **Lever:** `https://jobs.lever.co/{slug}`
- **Custom:** Company's own URL (e.g., `https://openai.com/careers`)

**If `careers_url` doesn't exist** for a company:
1. Try its known platform pattern
2. If fails, do quick WebSearch: `"{company}" careers jobs`
3. Navigate with Playwright to confirm it works
4. **Save found URL to portals.yml** for future scans

**If `careers_url` returns 404 or redirect:**
1. Note in output summary
2. Try scan_query as fallback
3. Mark for manual update

## portals.yml Maintenance

- **ALWAYS save `careers_url`** when adding a new company
- Add new queries as interesting portals or roles are discovered
- Disable queries with `enabled: false` if they generate too much noise
- Adjust filter keywords as target roles evolve
- Add companies to `tracked_companies` when you want to follow them closely
- Verify `careers_url` periodically — companies change ATS platforms
